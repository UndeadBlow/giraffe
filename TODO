  - Script/example for creating blast DB
  - How to add links to blast results?

Blast UI

---

Drawing bug - multiple labels highlighted on mouse over

Add tests
  - Allow GATCRYWSMKHBVDN
  - Orf detection
  - Cutter detection - report start, end, cut correctly
  - Orf, Feature, Cutter detection across boundary
  - Passing cutter information to javascript
  - EarI at start/boundary detected as cutter
  - JS accounts for EarI across boundary or before boundary but cut site afterward
  - JS accounts for cutter across boundary in N-cutter analysis
  - JS reports EarI at start and elsewhere as two cutter
  - JS expects alignment match to include | for match, empty space for mismatch
  - JS test to show we list in frame tags with ORF
  - JS test linear mode specifies circular boundary ORFs
  - JS test digest working correctly with cutter positions, incl EarI

Add examples
  - Ajax POST
  - Layers

Add JS helper to initiate POST and merge with existing features

Digest handling improvements
  - Digest handling pushed to BioJS? Take in cutters, produce digests?
  - Linear digest - showing EarI digest even when EarI is across boundary, this is wrong
  - EarI across boundary is considered a cutter in N-cutter analysis, this is wrong

Blast API
  - Return in order of escore
  - Getting word_size from params
  - Need UI widget?

Customize analyzer widget BLAST button - add custom blast buttons

Add back non-cutters analysis, but have to pass this in from backend
