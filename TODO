How to use widget embedded
  - How to add additional features to list of features
  - Make layers visible and not visible
  - Add JS helper to initial POST

Script/example for creating blast DB

Add tests
  - Allow GATCRYWSMKHBVDN
  - Orf detection
  - Cutter detection - report start, end, cut correctly
  - Passing cutter information to javascript
  - JS expects alignment match to include | for match, empty space for mismatch
  - JS test to show we list in frame tags with ORF
  - JS test linear mode specifies circular boundary ORFs

Show alignment part is slow; can we optimize this?

Blast API
  - Return in order of escore
  - Getting word_size from params
  - Need UI widget?

Add back non-cutters analysis, but have to pass this in from backend
