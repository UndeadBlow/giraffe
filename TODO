Add tests
  - Allow GATCRYWSMKHBVDN, but not in features
  - Cutter detection - report start, end, cut correctly
  - EarI at start/boundary detected as cutter

Digest handling improvements
  - Linear digest - showing EarI digest even when EarI is across boundary, this is wrong
  - EarI across boundary is considered a cutter in N-cutter analysis, this is wrong
