Drawing API: caller should call the GiraffeDraw function to get a drawing and
parsing object. The caller should use the object's read() method to read in a
JSON list of features, then call one of the object's <Foo>Map methods, with a
customized set of options.

The read() method can be passed as the JSONP argument to the BLAT get API (i.e.
API to retrieve array of features of a sequence from the server):

   <script src="/headers/js/raphael-min.js"></script>
   <script src="/headers/js/scale.raphael.js"></script>
   <script src="http://host/api/js/draw.js"></script>
   <script> var gd = GiraffeDraw2(); </script>
   <script src="http://host/blat/8de36469..../default?jsonp=gd.read">
   </script>

You can also manually pass features to read(). Note in each feature, the start
and end values should be in clockwise-direction. Use direction to indicate
antisense features.

*** Also, start and end values should be 1-indexed, not 0-indexed. ***

E.g.

<script>
  var gd = GiraffeDraw2();
  gd.read([3000,[{"show_feature":1,"start":"100","end":"1100","feature":"GeneA","type_id":1,"clockwise":true},...]])
  gd.CircularMap(...)
</script>

Here 3000 is total length of the plasmid.

After the feature data is read in, one (or many) plasmid maps can be drawn.
Options to the drawing function are passed in via a dictionary argument. For
example:

   <script>
   gd.CircularMap({ "map_dom_id" : "some_id", ... })
   </script>

Available options are:

map_dom_id: ID of the DOM element that contains the map. Default is
"giraffe-draw-map"

fade_time: if non-zero, then highlight a feature will cause an animated
fade-in/out effect. Default is 0.

opacity: opacity when features/enzymes is shown. if not 1.0, then when feature
is moused over or clicked on, the opacity will become 1.0. Default is 0.7.

map_width, map_height: default 640, 640.

plasmid_name: if given, show this name together with size of sequence in the
middle of the plasmid. Default is "".

label_offset: how far from the outter feature should we start drawing labels.
Default is "10".

cutters: which kinds of restriction enzymes to show, if any. This list of
integers is interpreted as follows: [1, 2]: show 1- and 2- cut restriction
enzymes. []: show nothing. etc. Default is [1].

feature_click_callback: a callback that gets called when a feature is clicked
on. Argument to this callback is a Feature object.

digest: draw the map like a restriction digest: features are very transparent
and have no labels, and enzymes are drawn like normal.

digest_fade_factor: fade the features by this much (multiplicative, in [0,1.0])
Defaults to 0.5.

draw_tic_mark: true or false.

region_start_offset: for bp tick marks, start at this offset
